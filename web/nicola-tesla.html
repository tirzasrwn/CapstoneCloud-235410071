                  Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,
                  [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943)
                  was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
                  mechanical engineer, and futurist. He is best-known for his
                  contributions to the design of the modern alternating current
                  (AC) electricity supply system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied
                  engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a
                  degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s
                  working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new
                  electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United
                  States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a
                  short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before
                  he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance
                  and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies
                  in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical
                  devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC
                  patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him
                  a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of
                  the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

                  Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market,
                  Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
                  oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early
                  X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one
                  of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an
                  inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and
                  wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship
                  at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his
                  ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric
                  power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power
                  experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made
                  pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication
                  with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical
                  use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an
                  intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter,
                  but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of
                  inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of
                  success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a
                  series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He
                  died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into
                  relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the
                  General Conference on Weights and Measures named the
                  International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic
                  flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a
                  resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.
